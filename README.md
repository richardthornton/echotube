## üé® Discord Embed Preview

EchoTube creates beautiful, minimal Discord notifications featuring:

- **Channel Name** - Clickable link to the YouTube channel
- **Video Title** - Clickable link to the YouTube video  
- **Large Thumbnail** - High-resolution video preview (1280x720)

---

## üìã Getting YouTube Channel/Playlist IDs

### Channel IDs (format: `UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
1. Go to the YouTube channel
2. Look at the URL: `youtube.com/channel/UCexample` or `youtube.com/c/channelname`  
3. If URL shows `/c/channelname`, view page source and search for `"channelId":"UC`

### Playlist IDs (format: `PLxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
1. Go to the YouTube playlist
2. Look at the URL: `youtube.com/playlist?list=PLexample`
3. Copy everything after `list=`

---

## üß™ Example Use Cases

- **Gaming Communities**: Monitor favorite streamers and post to multiple Discord servers
- **Educational Content**: Track programming tutorials and share across learning communities  
- **Content Curation**: Automatically share relevant videos in multiple community Discord servers
- **Development Updates**: Get notified about software releases in both team and public servers
- **Entertainment**: Follow content creators and cross-post to different interest-based servers

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **RSS Feed Limitation**: YouTube RSS feeds only show the **25 most recent videos**
- **Title-Only Matching**: Only matches video **titles** (descriptions/tags not available via RSS)
- **Public Content Only**: No access to private playlists or unlisted content
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Monitoring both channels AND their playlists may cause duplicate notifications
- **Rate Limiting**: Discord webhooks are rate-limited to prevent spam

---

## üîß Advanced Usage

Perfect for validating your configuration:
```bash
ET_TEST_MODE=true docker-compose up echotube-test
```

### Development Mode  
Posts only one video per source for testing:
```bash
ET_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true docker-compose up echotube-dev
```

### Custom Build
Build from source for development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/richardthornton/echotube.git
cd echotube
docker build -t echotube:custom .
```

## üêõ Need Help?

**Something not working?** Here's how to troubleshoot:

1. **Always test first**: Use `ET_TEST_MODE=true` to validate your setup safely
2. **Check the basics**: Verify your Discord webhook URLs are active and YouTube channel IDs are correct
3. **Look at logs**: Run `docker logs echotube` to see what's happening (logs show webhook-specific success/failures)
4. **Common issues**: Keywords are case-insensitive, RSS feeds only show 25 recent videos, and invalid webhook URLs will cause posting failures
