# Contributing to EchoTube

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EchoTube! We welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your help in making this project better.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:

1. **Check existing issues** - Someone might have already reported the same problem
2. **Use the latest version** - Make sure you're using the most recent release
3. **Test in a clean environment** - Try reproducing the issue with minimal configuration

When creating an issue, please include:
- **Clear description** of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Environment details** (Docker version, OS, etc.)
- **Configuration** (sanitized - remove webhook URLs and sensitive data)
- **Relevant logs** (use `ET_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for detailed output)

### Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! When suggesting features:

1. **Check existing discussions** - Your idea might already be under consideration
2. **Start with a discussion** - Open a GitHub Discussion to get community feedback
3. **Keep it focused** - One feature request per issue
4. **Explain the use case** - Help us understand why this would be valuable

### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echotube.git
   cd echotube
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch**:

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Environment

1. **Copy environment template**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your test configuration
   ```

2. **Use test mode for development**:

   docker build -t echotube:test .
   docker run --rm -e ET_TEST_MODE=true -e ET_CHANNEL_IDS=UCexample echotube:test
   ```

3. **Test different configurations**:
   - Multiple channels
   - Different keyword matching modes  
   - Various polling intervals
   - Development mode
